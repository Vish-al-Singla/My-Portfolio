        <h3>DEF: What is an Open Source License?</h2>
            <p>
                The simplest explanation is that open source licenses are legal and binding contracts between the
                author and the user of a software component, declaring that the software can be used in commercial
                applications under specified conditions. The license is what turns code into an open source
                component. Without an open source license, the software component is unusable by others, even if it
                has been publicly posted on GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each open source license states what users are permitted do with the software components, their
                obligations, and what they cannot do as per the terms and conditions. This might sound pretty straight
                forward, but there are over 200 open source licenses out there so good luck keeping them all organized.
                Varying in complexity and requirements, it is up to organizations to choose which licenses are most
                compatible with their policies to ensure that they remain compliant.
            </p>
            <h3>Copyleft and Permissive: Two Types of Open Source Licenses Explained</h3>
            <p>
                The two main categories of open source licenses often require in-depth explanation. Open source licenses
                can be divided into two main categories: copyleft and permissive. This division is based on the
                requirements and restrictions the license places on users.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Copyright</strong> is a law that restricts the right to use, modify, and share creative works
                without the
                permission of the copyright holder. Think about music, movies, etc that are the intellectual property of
                their creator. When an author releases a program under a copyleft license, they make a claim on the
                copyright of the work and issue a statement that other people have the right to use, modify, and share
                the work as long as the reciprocity of the obligation is maintained. In short, if they are using a
                component with this kind of open source license, then they too must make their code open for use by
                others as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> A permissive open source license</strong> is a non-copyleft open source license that guarantees
                the freedom to
                use, modify, and redistribute, while also permitting proprietary derivative works. Permissive open
                source licenses, lovingly referred to as “Anything Goes”, place minimal restrictions on how others can
                use open source components. That means that this type of license allows varying degrees of freedom to
                use, modify, and redistribute open source code, permitting its use in proprietary derivative works, and
                requiring nearly nothing in return in regards to obligations moving forward.
            </p>
            <h3>Top Open Source Licences</h3>
            <p>
                It’s important to note that there are no good or bad licenses, and that no one license is better than
                another. Anyone can create an open source license that suits their fancy, which is the reason that there
                are so many out there. This could make choosing an open source license complicated business, especially
                for those of us who are not well versed in the law and have never had open source licenses explained
                thoroughly.
            </p>
            <h4>The Apache License</h4>
            <p>
                <img class="AL"
                    src="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/wp-content/media/2021/04/aHViPTcyNTE0JmNtZD1pdGVtZWRpdG9yaW1hZ2UmZmlsZW5hbWU9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlXzVjNDk3N2MwNGE5MDYucG5nJnZlcnNpb249MDAwMCZzaWc9ZGYwZGI5N2EwYjViOTEzOTdkOWExMjc2YjUyNGM3MTY.png"
                    alt="The Apache License">

                The Apache License is an open source software license released by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
                It’s a popular and widely deployed license backed by a strong community. The Apache License allows you
                to freely use, modify, and distribute any Apache licensed product. However, while doing so, you’re
                required to follow the terms of the Apache License.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Apache Group (later named the Apache Software Foundation) released the first version of its license
                in 1995, but it’s rare that you’ll come across components that still carry this license.
            </p>
            <p>In 2000, when Berkeley accepted the argument put to it by the Free Software Foundation and retired their
                advertising clause from the BSD license and formed the modified BSD license, Apache did likewise and
                created the Apache License version 1.1.
            </p>
            <p>Removing the advertising clause meant that the advertising materials of the derivative works of any
                Apache licensed product were no longer required to include the Apache License attribution. It became ok
                to include the attribution in the documentation alone.
            </p>
            <p>In 2004, the ASF decided to depart from the BSD model a little more radically and produced the Apache
                License version 2.0 by granting patents rights and defining solid definitions of the concepts it uses to
                make it more coherent.</p>
            <h4>GNU General Public License (GPL)</h4>
            <p>
                <img class="GNU"
                    src="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/wp-content/media/2021/04/aHViPTcyNTE0JmNtZD1pdGVtZWRpdG9yaW1hZ2UmZmlsZW5hbWU9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlXzVjNDk3NmFlNDM5Y2QucG5nJnZlcnNpb249MDAwMCZzaWc9NDQ0MzgxMTNmN2U3NDliM2U1MGE2ZjNkNzA2YzU5NDA.png"
                    alt="GNU">
                The GNU’s General Public License is the most popular open source license around. Richard Stallman
                created the GPL to protect the GNU software from becoming proprietary, and it is a specific
                implementation of his “copyleft” concept.
            </p>
            <p>GPL is a copyleft license. This means that any software that is written based on any GPL component must
                be released as open source. The result is that any software that uses any GPL open source component
                (regardless of its percentage in the entire code) is required to release its full source code and all of
                the rights to modify and distribute the entire code.</p>
            <p>There has always been some confusion regarding what constitutes a ‘work based on’ another work, which in
                turn triggers the GPL reciprocity obligation. The FSF tried to add more clarity to GPLv3 as to when the
                reciprocity obligation is triggered. The FSF even wrote a new GPL license, the Affero license, to
                address a specific confusion referred to as the “ASP loophole”.</p>
            <p>In addition, the FSF tried to increase the compatibility of the GPLv3 with other licenses. To combine two
                codes into a larger work, both the programs must permit it. If such rights are granted by both the
                programs’ licenses, they are compatible. By making the GPLv3 more compatible, the FSF expanded
                development options.</p>
            <p>The third difference between the two versions is that the GPLv3 was written in an attempt to increase
                usage worldwide. The language used in GPLv3 to describe the license rights was modified to ensure that
                international laws will interpret it as the FSF intended, unlike the language used in GPLv2, which is
                considered very US-centric. GPLv3 also allows developers to add local disclaimers, which also helps
                increase its usage outside the US.</p>
            <h4>Microsoft Public Licenses (Ms-PL)</h4>
            <p>
                <img class="Ms"
                    src="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/wp-content/media/2021/04/aHViPTcyNTE0JmNtZD1pdGVtZWRpdG9yaW1hZ2UmZmlsZW5hbWU9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlXzVjNDk3ODI4M2M3MTgucG5nJnZlcnNpb249MDAwMCZzaWc9OTA3MjIxYjkzYzVhOWFjZDk0YjI3YjE4MDZmMmQxODc.png"
                    alt="Ms-PL">
                The Microsoft Public License is a free and open source software license released by Microsoft, which
                wrote it for its projects that were released as open source.
            </p>
            <p>You are free to reproduce and distribute original or derivative works of any software licensed under the
                Ms-PL license. However, you may not use any contributors’ name, logo, or trademarks when you do so. The
                Ms-PL protects the authors by explicitly not offering any express warranties or guarantees for using
                your code, so the author is not liable if the code doesn’t work well in some cases.</p>
            <p>When you distribute software (or its portion) under the Ms-PL, you’re not required to distribute its
                source code. You may do so if you want to, but you’re not obliged. However, you’re required to retain
                all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are originally present in the software.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, if you distribute any portion of the software in its source code form, you may do so only
                under the Ms-PL by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute
                any portion of the software in its compiled or object code form, you may only do so under any other
                license that complies with the Ms-PL.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that the Ms-PL terms and conditions document is very short, concise and written
                in a very coherent language. Microsoft wanted to be very clear and direct with the open source
                community, which also helps the adoption rate (as we know from the BSD license).</p>
            <h4>Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)</h4>
            <p>
                <img class="BSD"

                    alt="BSD">
                BSD Licenses or the original BSD License and its two variants – the Modified BSD License (3-clause), and
                the Simplified BSD License/FreeBSD License (2-clause) are a family of permissive free software licenses.
            </p>
            <p>The BSD License lets you freely modify and distribute your software’s code in the source or binary format
                as long as you retain a copy of the copyright notice, list of conditions, and the disclaimer.</p>
            <p>The original BSD License or the 4-clause BSD License also contains an advertising clause and a
                non-endorsement clause (detailed explanation about these clauses are offered in the following
                questions). The modified BSD License or the 3-clause BSD License was formed by removing the advertising
                clause from the original BSD License. Further, the FreeBSD version or the 2-clause BSD License was
                formed by removing the non-endorsement clause from the modified BSD License or the 3-clause BSD License.

                    alt="CDDL">

                CDDL is an open source license published by Sun Microsystems to replace the Sun Public License (SPL).
                The CDDL license is considered by Sun (now Oracle) to be SPL version 2. It is inspired by the Mozilla
                Public License (MPL). Sun used to release its free software / open source projects under its Sun Public
                License (SPL) before it turned to rely upon the CDDL in 2004. CDDL is often dubbed as a cleaned up
                version of the MPL and is made to facilitate reusability.
            </p>
            <p>You’re free to reproduce and distribute any original or derivative works of any software licensed under
                the CDDL. However, you must not remove or make any changes to any copyright, patent or trademark notices
                contained in the software. You must also retain any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
                attribution to any contributor or the initial developer.</p>
            <p>When you distribute your software in an executable form (any form other than source code), you are
                required to make the source code available as well under the CDDL. The executable form may be released
                under the CDDL or any CDDL compatible licenses.</p>
            <p>The source code that you have to make available includes your contributions as long as they are an
                addition to, deletion from or modification of the contents of a file containing the original software –
                or new files that contain parts of the original program. That means that if your additions are made in
                separate and independent files that do not contain the original code, you do not have to release it
                under the CDDL. You may do that if you choose to, but you’re not obliged.</p>
            <p>In addition, you must include a copy of the CDDL with any source code that you distribute. For each
                modification that you make, you must identify yourself as the modifier by including a notice in your
                modified files.</p>
            <h4>Eclipse Public License (EPL)</h4>

                    alt="EPL">

                The Eclipse Public License (EPL) is an open source license developed by the Eclipse Foundation. It’s
                derived from the Common Public License (CPL). The Eclipse codebase now available under the EPL was
                formerly licensed under the CPL.
            </p>
            <p>The EPL license is a copyleft license. If you modify an EPL’ed component and distribute it in the source
                code form as part of your program, you’re required to disclose the modified code under the EPL. If you
                distribute such a program in its object code form, you’re required to state that the source code can be
                made available to the recipient upon request. You’re also required to share the method for requesting
                the source code.</p>
            <p>The Eclipse Foundation makes clear that, in their opinion, ‘merely interfacing or interoperating’ with an
                Eclipse plugin does not make your code a derivative work of the plugin.
                If you redistribute a program with an EPL component, you are obligated to include the full license text
                and the copyrights.</p>
            <p>The EPL protects the author from possible lawsuits or damages caused if a company used his/her component
                in a commercial product. It also offers a patent grant.</p>

                    alt="MIT L">
                The MIT License, created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the late ‘80s, is one of the
                most permissive free software licenses. Basically, you can do whatever you want with software licensed
                under the MIT license — as long as you add a copy of the original MIT license and copyright notice to
                it. The MIT License is very simple, short and to the point, which is why it has such a high adoption
                rate among developers, although some avoid it because it doesn’t expressly grant patent rights.
                Commercial organizations often prefer it because of its “no strings attached” nature.

            <h2>Know Your Open Source Licenses, Or Explain it to the Judge</h2>
            <p>If you’ve gotten this far, then you know that open source licenses are not for the faint of heart.</p>
            <p>However, considering the fact that nearly all software developers rely heavily on open source components,
                it’s crucial to understand the basics of open source licensing, and the main differences between the
                popular open source licenses out there.</p>
            <p>We only hope that this explanation has made the potential minefield of licenses just a little more
                navigatable.</p>
