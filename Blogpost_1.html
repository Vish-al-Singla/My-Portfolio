    <section class="exp ow">
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>It is version control system. It is most widely used tool in today's modern world.
            Git is mature, actively maintained open source project. It helps us maintain our project in neat and clean
            manner easily.
            It provides many features like copying our files on cloud , saving them fo further use, and also reusing
            them to make more projects.
            It has been designed with performance, security andd flexibility in mind.

        </p>
        <p>
            Git is the most broadly adopted tool of its kind. Many third party software tools and services are alread integrated with Git including IDEs.
            If you are an inexperienced developer wanting to build up valuable skills in software dev tools, Git should be on your list.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The raw performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives.
            Commiting new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance.
            All douce code files are frequently renamed, split and rearranged.</p>
        <p>
            For example, you make changes to any piece of code , adding any feature or update, you commit the changes
            with message.
            Then after a week you commit another changes then this changes will be stored differentely from the first
            ones in the history.
            You can also work with a branch of that repo as there are different team members who want to check you
            changes before making the final changes in the code. So, git helps you with branching feature here.
            And you can commit all the changes made in project all at once using "git push" command.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            The content of files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and
            commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing
            algorithm called SHA1.
        </p>
        <p>With git, you have an authenti content history of your source code.
        </p>
        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
            Git is flexible in several ways.Like it's efficiency in both small and large projects and its compatibilit
            with many existing systems and protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
            Git has been designed to support branching and tagging and operations that affect branches and tags are also
            stored as part of the change history.
        </p>
