    <section class="exp ow">
    
    <h3>How I started</h3>
    <p>First of all, I will discuss about how I get to know about Neogcamp. Around February,2021 I came across HTML, CSS
        on internet sites. I found a course in HTML, CSS interesting and started my career in Web Development. Likewise,
        I started exploring many more Web Dev courses.</p>
    <h3>How I learnt about NeogCamp</h3>
    <p>After doing HTML courses still I was not feeling like I know HTML well.
        But one day, my friend <strong> Nikhil</strong> called me and started asking to do a Web Development course
        together.
        I told him about the coincidence as I was also looking for a companion with whom I can discuss the course and
        can solve problem together.
        Then he referred from his cousin about staring learning Javascript and React.Js to able to create a To-Do app. 
        Which will help us in building aour career in Web Development. Like this we started doing Javascript courses.
        One day, Nikhil got to know about Neogcamp from his friend that <strong>Neogcamp</strong> is providing free basic level course with <strong>Wonderful and mind-boggling</strong>
        projects to polish our portfolios. Then we started the Neogcamp's <strong>Level 0</strong> which was designed for beginners.
    </p>
    <h3>Completion of Level 0</h3>
    <p>After taking online classes of <strong>Tanay Pratap </strong> Sir I can say that now I have become half of the expert in Web Development. I can't explain in words how my standard has rasied after the Neogcamp's classes. The knowledge I gained is of vast use and I can expand this knowledge by attending Level 1 provided by Tanay Sir.
    I am excited to complete my Level 0 and give interview to enter Level 1.</p>
